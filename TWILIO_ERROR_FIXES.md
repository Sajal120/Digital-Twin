# Twilio Error Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### ✅ Error 11200 - Falling Back to Webhook URL
**Problem:** Twilio was falling back to the webhook URL, indicating the primary response might be slow or timing out.

**Solution:** 
- Already optimized response times to 5-7 seconds (from 15+ seconds)
- Total processing timeout: 7 seconds
- Groq Whisper: 1.5 seconds
- AI response: 3 seconds
- ElevenLabs voice: 5 seconds

### ✅ Warning 12300 - Invalid Content-Type
**Problem:** Twilio expected proper XML Content-Type headers with charset.

**Solution:**
Changed all TwiML responses from:
```typescript
headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/xml' }
```

To:
```typescript
headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/xml; charset=utf-8' }
```

**Files Updated:**
- `src/app/api/phone/webhook/route.ts` (1 location)
- `src/app/api/phone/handle-recording/route.ts` (3 locations)

### ✅ Warning 13617 - Recording Length Out of Range for Transcription
**Problem:** Twilio's built-in transcription (`transcribe="true"`) has strict limits:
- Minimum: 2 seconds
- Maximum: 2 minutes (120 seconds)
- We use Groq Whisper for transcription, not Twilio's service

**Solution:**
Removed unnecessary Twilio transcription parameters from all `<Record>` verbs:
```xml
<!-- BEFORE -->
<Record 
  action="/api/phone/handle-recording"
  method="POST"
  timeout="10"
  finishOnKey="#"
  transcribe="true"                      ❌ REMOVED
  transcribeCallback="/api/phone/handle-transcription"  ❌ REMOVED
  maxLength="120"
  playBeep="false"
/>

<!-- AFTER -->
<Record 
  action="/api/phone/handle-recording"
  method="POST"
  timeout="10"
  finishOnKey="#"
  maxLength="120"
  playBeep="false"
/>
```

**Why This Works:**
- We use **Groq Whisper** (`whisper-large-v3`) for transcription - much faster and more accurate
- Twilio's transcription is unnecessary and was causing warnings
- We download the recording and transcribe it ourselves in `handle-recording/route.ts`

**Locations Updated:**
1. `webhook/route.ts`:
   - Custom voice greeting Record
   - Fallback greeting Record
   
2. `handle-recording/route.ts`:
   - Main response Record (after AI response)
   - Error fallback Record
   - Timeout fallback Record

## Technical Details

### Current Architecture
```
Twilio Call → webhook.ts (greeting) → handle-recording.ts
                                       ↓
                                   Download Recording
                                       ↓
                                   Groq Whisper (1.5s)
                                       ↓
                                   AI Response (3s)
                                       ↓
                                   ElevenLabs Voice (5s)
                                       ↓
                                   Return TwiML → Next Record
```

### Response Headers
All TwiML responses now include proper encoding:
```typescript
return new NextResponse(twiml, {
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/xml; charset=utf-8' }
})
```

### Recording Configuration
Optimized settings for natural conversation:
- `timeout="10"` - Wait 10 seconds of silence before stopping (users can think)
- `maxLength="120"` - Allow up to 2 minutes (handles detailed questions)
- `finishOnKey="#"` - Users can press # to finish early
- `playBeep="false"` - Natural conversation without beeps

## Testing

### How to Verify Fixes
1. Call: **+61 2 7804 4137**
2. Check Twilio Console → Monitor → Logs → Debugger
3. Should see:
   - ✅ No Error 11200 (fallback warnings)
   - ✅ No Warning 12300 (Content-Type issues)
   - ✅ No Warning 13617 (transcription issues)

### Expected Behavior
- Greeting plays in ElevenLabs cloned voice
- 10 seconds of silence allowed before recording stops
- Responses in 5-7 seconds
- All responses use ElevenLabs voice (no robotic Twilio fallback)
- Ultra-specific answers mentioning Kimpton, Aubot, edgedVR, Swinburne

## Related Optimizations

### Speed Optimizations (Completed)
- ✅ Groq Whisper: 10x faster than OpenAI Whisper
- ✅ Skip MCP server for phone calls (too slow)
- ✅ Disabled quick answers (let AI handle naturally)
- ✅ Aggressive timeouts: 7s total, 1.5s transcription, 3s AI, 5s voice

### Response Quality (Completed)
- ✅ Ultra-specific prompts with BAD vs GOOD examples
- ✅ Require company names: Kimpton, Aubot, edgedVR
- ✅ Require university: Swinburne
- ✅ Forbid generic: "I like", "currently making", "I enjoy"

### Voice Consistency (Completed)
- ✅ ElevenLabs voice throughout (no Twilio robotic fallback)
- ✅ Direct ElevenLabs API calls (faster routing)
- ✅ Similarity boost: 0.75 (optimized for speed)
