# AI Control Mode - Quick Actions Only

## 🎯 Purpose
AI Control mode is now **strictly limited** to 5 Quick Actions. It will **not** answer general questions.

## ✅ What AI Control Does

AI Control mode **ONLY** works with these 5 quick actions:

1. **About** - Shows "About Me" section
2. **Experience** - Shows work experience
3. **Skills** - Shows technical skills
4. **Projects** - Shows project portfolio
5. **Contact** - Shows contact information

### How It Works:
1. User asks: "Show me your projects"
2. AI detects intent: `show_projects`
3. Shows brief message: "Here are my projects! ✨"
4. Triggers page action: Scrolls to projects section
5. Auto-hides chat after 3 seconds

## ❌ What AI Control Does NOT Do

AI Control will **reject** any questions that don't match the 5 quick actions.

### Examples of Rejected Queries:
- "What's your favorite programming language?" ❌
- "Tell me about yourself" ❌ (too vague, not a quick action)
- "How are you?" ❌
- "What do you think about AI?" ❌
- Any general conversation ❌

### Error Message Shown:
```
❌ AI Control mode only works with Quick Actions:

• About
• Experience
• Skills
• Projects
• Contact

For general questions, please use **Plain Chat** mode! 💬
```

## 💬 For General Questions: Use Plain Chat

Plain Chat mode is for:
- ✅ Detailed conversations
- ✅ Technical questions
- ✅ Background inquiries
- ✅ Multi-turn conversations
- ✅ Follow-up questions
- ✅ Any topic not in the 5 quick actions

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Welcome Message (AI Control):
```
Hi! 🤖 AI Control is for **Quick Actions only**:

• About
• Experience
• Skills
• Projects
• Contact

For questions, please use **Plain Chat** mode! 💬
```

### Code Flow:

```typescript
if (chatMode === 'ai_control') {
  const intent = detectIntent(inputValue)
  
  if (intent) {
    // ✅ Valid quick action detected
    switch (intent.type) {
      case 'show_about': return "Here's my story! 👋"
      case 'show_experience': return "Here's my experience! 💼"
      case 'show_skills': return "Check out my skills! 🚀"
      case 'show_projects': return "Here are my projects! ✨"
      case 'show_contact': return "Let's connect! 📧"
    }
    // Trigger page action & auto-hide
  } else {
    // ❌ No intent detected - reject the query
    return "❌ AI Control mode only works with Quick Actions..."
  }
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Early Return**: AI Control never reaches API call
2. **Intent Required**: Must detect one of 5 quick action intents
3. **Error Message**: Shows helpful message for invalid queries
4. **Clear Purpose**: Welcome message clarifies restrictions

## 🎨 User Experience

User: "show me your skills"
Bot: "Check out my skills! 🚀"
      [Scrolls to skills section]
      [Auto-hides chat]
```

```
User: "what's your favorite language?"
Bot: "❌ AI Control mode only works with Quick Actions:
     
     • About
     • Experience
     • Skills
     • Projects
     • Contact

```

### Plain Chat Mode:
```
User: "what's your favorite language?"
Bot: "I'm passionate about TypeScript because of its type safety
     and developer experience. It helps catch bugs early and makes
     large codebases more maintainable. However, I also love..."

## 📊 Comparison Table

| Feature | AI Control | Plain Chat |
|---------|-----------|------------|

## 🎯 Design Rationale

### Why Restrict AI Control?

1. **Clear Purpose**: Each mode has a distinct role
2. **User Guidance**: Forces users to use the right tool
3. **Performance**: No API calls for simple actions
4. **UX Clarity**: Reduces confusion about mode differences
5. **Intent Focus**: AI Control is for navigation, not conversation

### Mode Separation:
- **AI Control** = Navigation assistant (Quick Actions)
- **Plain Chat** = Conversation partner (Detailed Q&A)
- **Voice Chat** = Spoken conversation

## 🚀 Benefits

### For Users:
- ✅ Clear expectations per mode
- ✅ Guided to correct mode
- ✅ Faster quick actions
- ✅ Better conversation in Plain Chat

### For System:
- ✅ Reduced API calls (AI Control doesn't call API)
- ✅ Simpler intent detection
- ✅ Clearer code separation
- ✅ Better performance

## 📝 Examples

### ✅ Valid AI Control Queries:
```
"Show me your projects"
"Display your skills"
"I want to see your experience"
"Show contact info"
"Tell me about you" (matches 'about' intent)
```

### ❌ Invalid AI Control Queries (Use Plain Chat):
```
"What technologies do you use?"
"How did you learn programming?"
"What's your biggest achievement?"
"Where do you work?"
"Tell me a story"
```
