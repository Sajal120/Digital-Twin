## 🎯 How It Works

1. **User lands** → See beautiful intro screen
2. **User clicks "Talk to Digital Twin"** → Chat opens with animation
3. **User speaks/types** → AI processes message
4. **Intent detected** → UI transforms (projects, skills, resume, etc.)
5. **Background responds** → Colors, particles adjust
6. **Voice syncs** → Visuals pulse with speech
7. **Natural conversation** → Everything flows smoothly

## 💡 Example Commands

Try these in the chat:
- "Show me your projects"
- "What are your skills?"
- "Can I see your resume?"
- "How can I contact you?"
- "Tell me about yourself"
- "Go back to start"

## 🚀 Testing Instructions

1. **Start server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Open**: `http://localhost:3000`
3. **Click**: "Talk to My Digital Twin"
4. **Type or speak**: "show projects"
5. **Watch**: Projects animate in!

## 🎨 Customization
