For SQL optimization, during my Aubot internship I optimized database queries for student performance analytics, reducing query times by 40%. My DevOps Cost Optimizer used complex SQL joins across multiple AWS billing tables to identify cost patterns. I approach system design by first understanding the business problem, then designing for scalability - like my AI Digital Twin using RAG architecture that can handle concurrent users. I always write tests first, use proper error handling, and document thoroughly. My code review process focuses on performance, readability, and maintainability.",
