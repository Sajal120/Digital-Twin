# Query Enhancement Speech Fix ‚úÖ

**Date**: October 27, 2025  
**Issue**: AI was speaking "Query Enhancement: ..." text even though it was removed from UI display

## Problem

The user reported:
> "In UI text there is no text enhancement good but. its speaking the query enhancement. i actually dont want my ai to speak query enhancement"

**What was happening:**
1. ‚úÖ UI text was clean (Query Enhancement removed for display)
2. ‚ùå Speech (TTS) was still speaking the Query Enhancement text
3. **Root cause**: Text cleaning was done for UI display, but the **original uncleaned text** was being sent to TTS

## Solution

Added **aggressive text cleaning RIGHT BEFORE speech generation** to ensure Query Enhancement and other metadata never reaches the TTS API.

### Code Changes

**File**: `/src/components/digital-twin/AIControllerChat.tsx`

**Location**: Lines 700-716 (before calling `generateAndPlaySpeech`)

```typescript
// Step 3: Clean text AGAIN before speech (remove any Query Enhancement that might have slipped through)
const cleanedForSpeech = aiResponseText
  .replace(/Query Enhancement:[^\n]*/gi, '') // Remove Query Enhancement line
  .replace(/IMPORTANT:[^\n]*/gi, '') // Remove IMPORTANT lines
  .replace(/\[respond in[^\]]*\]/gi, '') // Remove language instructions
  .replace(/\[Respond in[^\]]*\]/gi, '') // Capital R version
  .replace(/Processing Mode:[^\n]*/gi, '')
  .replace(/Enhanced RAG[^\n]*/gi, '')
  .replace(/LLM-Enhanced[^\n]*/gi, '')
  .replace(/\*\*Enhanced Interview Response\*\*[^\n]*/gi, '')
  .trim()

console.log('üîä Generating speech...')
console.log('üìù Text for speech:', cleanedForSpeech.substring(0, 100) + '...')
await generateAndPlaySpeech(cleanedForSpeech, detectedLanguage)
```

**Before fix:**
```typescript
// Step 3: Generate speech using TTS API (following phone architecture)
console.log('üîä Generating speech...')
await generateAndPlaySpeech(aiResponseText, detectedLanguage) // ‚ùå Using raw text
```

**After fix:**
```typescript
// Step 3: Clean text AGAIN before speech
const cleanedForSpeech = aiResponseText
  .replace(/Query Enhancement:[^\n]*/gi, '')
  // ... more cleaning rules
  .trim()

console.log('üîä Generating speech...')
console.log('üìù Text for speech:', cleanedForSpeech.substring(0, 100) + '...')
await generateAndPlaySpeech(cleanedForSpeech, detectedLanguage) // ‚úÖ Using cleaned text
```

## What Gets Removed from Speech

The following patterns are now **guaranteed to be removed** before TTS:

1. **Query Enhancement**: `Query Enhancement: ...`
2. **IMPORTANT instructions**: `IMPORTANT: ...`
3. **Language instructions**: `[respond in the same language...]`, `[Respond in Hindi...]`
4. **Processing modes**: `Processing Mode: ...`
5. **RAG metadata**: `Enhanced RAG`, `LLM-Enhanced RAG`
6. **Interview response headers**: `**Enhanced Interview Response**`

## Flow Comparison

### Before Fix:
```
MCP Response ‚Üí Clean for UI Display ‚Üí Show in UI ‚úÖ
              ‚Üí Send to TTS (raw) ‚Üí AI speaks metadata ‚ùå
```

### After Fix:
```
MCP Response ‚Üí Clean for UI Display ‚Üí Show in UI ‚úÖ
              ‚Üí Clean for Speech ‚Üí Send to TTS ‚Üí AI speaks clean text ‚úÖ
```

## Console Logs

New debug log to verify speech text:
```
üîä Generating speech...
üìù Text for speech: Haan bhai, main Hindi mein reply karunga. Kya jaan...
```

This shows exactly what text is being sent to Cartesia TTS API.

## Testing

**Test case from user's conversation:**

**Before:**
```
User: "‡§§‡•Å‡§Æ‡§®‡•á ‡§ñ‡§æ‡§®‡§æ ‡§ñ‡§æ ‡§≤‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ, ‡§ï‡•à‡§∏‡•á ‡§π‡•ã ‡§≠‡§æ‡§à?"
AI speaks: "Query Enhancement: ... Haan bhai, main Hindi mein reply karunga..."
```

**After:**
```
User: "‡§§‡•Å‡§Æ‡§®‡•á ‡§ñ‡§æ‡§®‡§æ ‡§ñ‡§æ ‡§≤‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ, ‡§ï‡•à‡§∏‡•á ‡§π‡•ã ‡§≠‡§æ‡§à?"
AI speaks: "Haan bhai, main Hindi mein reply karunga..." ‚úÖ (no metadata)
```

## Why Double Cleaning?

You might wonder: "Why clean twice? Why not just clean once before both UI and speech?"

**Answer**: Defense in depth!
- First cleaning (line 630-665): For UI display and memory storage
- Second cleaning (line 700-716): Extra safety before speech
- Some edge cases might slip through one filter but get caught by the other
- Speech is more critical - you can't unsee text, but unwanted speech is more disruptive

## Related Fixes

This is part of a series of Query Enhancement cleanup fixes:

1. ‚úÖ **UI Display**: Removed from chat messages (done earlier)
2. ‚úÖ **Memory Storage**: Cleaned before storing in conversation memory (done earlier)  
3. ‚úÖ **History Generation**: Removed from history summaries (done earlier)
4. ‚úÖ **Speech (NEW)**: Removed before TTS API call (this fix)

**Status**: Query Enhancement is now completely removed from all user-facing outputs including speech! üéâ
