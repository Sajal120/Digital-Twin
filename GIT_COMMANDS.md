# Git Time Travel Commands for Portfolio Project

## üöÄ Current Setup
- **Main Branch**: `main` - Your current working branch with complete portfolio
- **Version Tag**: `v1.0.0` - Complete AI-powered portfolio milestone
- **Feature Branches**: Ready for different development tracks

## üï∞Ô∏è Time Travel Commands

### View History & Navigate
```bash
# See commit history with visual graph
git log --oneline --graph --all --decorate

# View specific file changes over time
git log --follow --patch -- src/app/api/chat/route.ts

# See what changed in last commit
git show HEAD

# Compare current vs previous version
git diff HEAD~1
```

### Jump to Specific Points in Time
```bash
# Go back to v1.0.0 (your current portfolio state)
git checkout v1.0.0

# Return to latest main branch
git checkout main

# Go back N commits (e.g., 3 commits ago)
git checkout HEAD~3

# Return to main from any point
git checkout main
```

### Create Snapshots & Checkpoints
```bash
# Save current work without committing
git stash push -m "Work in progress on AI chat improvements"

# List all stashes
git stash list

# Restore stashed work
git stash pop

# Create a new branch from current state
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
```

### Branch Navigation
```bash
# Switch between branches
git checkout development          # For testing new features
git checkout feature/ai-chat-optimization  # For chat improvements
git checkout production          # For deployment-ready code
git checkout main               # Back to main development

# Create and switch to new branch in one command
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
```

### Compare Different Time Points
```bash
# Compare two commits
git diff v1.0.0 HEAD

# Compare two branches
git diff main development

# See what files changed between versions
git diff --name-only v1.0.0 HEAD
```

### Undo Changes (Time Travel Back)
```bash
# Undo last commit but keep changes
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit and discard changes (CAREFUL!)
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Undo specific file to last commit
git checkout -- src/app/api/chat/route.ts

# Create new commit that undoes previous commit
git revert HEAD
```

### Advanced Time Travel
```bash
# Find when something was changed
git blame src/app/api/chat/route.ts

# Search commit messages
git log --grep="AI chat"

# Find commits that changed specific text
git log -S "useEffect" --source --all

# Interactive rebase to edit history
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

## üìä Quick Status Commands
```bash
# Current status
git status

# Show branches and current location
git branch -v

# Show all tags
git tag

# Show remote repositories (when you add one)
git remote -v
```

## üè∑Ô∏è Version Tagging System
```bash
# Create new version tags as you develop
git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "Added new portfolio feature"
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Enhanced AI chat responses"

# List all versions
git tag -l

# Jump to specific version
git checkout v1.1.0
```

## üö® Emergency Recovery
```bash
# If you get lost, see where you've been
git reflog

# Recover from reflog (replace abc1234 with actual hash)
git checkout abc1234

# Nuclear option - reset everything to last known good state
git reset --hard v1.0.0
```

## üí° Recommended Workflow
1. **Before making changes**: `git status` (check current state)
2. **Work on features**: Use feature branches
3. **Save progress**: Commit regularly with good messages
4. **Before big changes**: Create a tag or branch as backup
5. **Return to safety**: Always have `main` and `v1.0.0` as fallback points

Your portfolio is now fully version controlled! üéâ
