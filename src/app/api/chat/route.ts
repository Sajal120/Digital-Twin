&bull; Modern component architecture with TypeScript
&bull; Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
&bull; Database integration for storing chat conversations
&bull; Smooth animations and professional UI components

I'm also planning some other React projects including a task management app and a VR content showcase platform that builds on my edgedVR experience.

What I love about React is how it lets you build complex, interactive user interfaces with reusable components. Combined with modern tools like Next.js, it's perfect for creating full-stack applications like this chatbot.
