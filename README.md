## 📦 Project Structure## Lexical editor



```A deep editorial experience that allows complete freedom to focus just on writing content without breaking out of the flow with support for Payload blocks, media, links and other features provided out of the box. See [Lexical](https://payloadcms.com/docs/rich-text/overview) docs.

│   ├── collections/      # Payload CMS collections

│   ├── components/       # React componentsAll posts and pages are draft-enabled so you can preview them before publishing them to your website. To do this, these collections use [Versions](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/collections#versions) with `drafts` set to `true`. This means that when you create a new post, project, or page, it will be saved as a draft and will not be visible on your website until you publish it. This also means that you can preview your draft before publishing it to your website. To do this, we automatically format a custom URL which redirects to your front-end to securely fetch the draft version of your content.

## On-demand Revalidation

## 🎨 Key Features Explained

We've added hooks to collections and globals so that all of your pages, posts, footer, or header changes will automatically be updated in the frontend via on-demand revalidation supported by Nextjs.

### AI Chatbot with RAG

> Note: if an image has been changed, for example it's been cropped, you will need to republish the page it's used on in order to be able to revalidate the Nextjs image cache.

The chatbot uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation to provide accurate, context-aware responses:

## SEO

1. User queries are embedded using OpenAI's embedding models

2. Relevant content is retrieved from Upstash Vector DatabaseThis template comes pre-configured with the official [Payload SEO Plugin](https://payloadcms.com/docs/plugins/seo) for complete SEO control from the admin panel. All SEO data is fully integrated into the front-end website that comes with this template. See [Website](#website) for more details.

3. Context is passed to Groq's LLM for response generation

4. Enhanced with GitHub/LinkedIn integration for professional context## Search



### Voice AI SystemThis template also pre-configured with the official [Payload Search Plugin](https://payloadcms.com/docs/plugins/search) to showcase how SSR search features can easily be implemented into Next.js with Payload. See [Website](#website) for more details.



Real-time voice interaction powered by:## Redirects

- **OpenAI Realtime API**: Natural voice conversations

- **ElevenLabs**: Multi-language voice cloningIf you are migrating an existing site or moving content to a new URL, you can use the `redirects` collection to create a proper redirect from old URLs to new ones. This will ensure that proper request status codes are returned to search engines and that your users are not left with a broken link. This template comes pre-configured with the official [Payload Redirects Plugin](https://payloadcms.com/docs/plugins/redirects) for complete redirect control from the admin panel. All redirects are fully integrated into the front-end website that comes with this template. See [Website](#website) for more details.

- **Deepgram**: Accurate speech-to-text transcription

- **Language Detection**: Automatic language identification## Jobs and Scheduled Publish



### Content ManagementWe have configured [Scheduled Publish](https://payloadcms.com/docs/versions/drafts#scheduled-publish) which uses the [jobs queue](https://payloadcms.com/docs/jobs-queue/jobs) in order to publish or unpublish your content on a scheduled time. The tasks are run on a cron schedule and can also be run as a separate instance if needed.



Payload CMS provides:> Note: When deployed on Vercel, depending on the plan tier, you may be limited to daily cron only.

- User-friendly admin panel at `/admin`

- Custom collections for pages, posts, and media## Website

- Draft/publish workflow

- Image optimization and focal point selectionThis template includes a beautifully designed, production-ready front-end built with the [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org), served right alongside your Payload app in a instance. This makes it so that you can deploy both your backend and website where you need it.

- SEO meta management

This means that Next.js caching is not needed and is disabled by default. If you are hosting your app outside of Payload Cloud, you can easily reenable the Next.js caching mechanisms by removing the `no-store` directive from all fetch requests in `./src/app/_api` and then removing all instances of `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` from pages files, such as `./src/app/(pages)/[slug]/page.tsx`.

```To spin up this example locally, follow the [Quick Start](#quick-start). Then [Seed](#seed) the database with a few pages, posts, and projects.



## 🌍 Deployment### Working with Postgres



### Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)Postgres and other SQL-based databases follow a strict schema for managing your data. In comparison to our MongoDB adapter, this means that there's a few extra steps to working with Postgres.



1. Push your code to GitHubNote that often times when making big schema changes you can run the risk of losing data if you're not manually migrating it.

2. Import project in Vercel

3. Configure environment variables#### Local development

4. Deploy!

Ideally we recommend running a local copy of your database so that schema updates are as fast as possible. By default the Postgres adapter has `push: true` for development environments. This will let you add, modify and remove fields and collections without needing to run any data migrations.

Vercel automatically detects Next.js and configures optimal settings.

If your database is pointed to production you will want to set `push: false` otherwise you will risk losing data or having your migrations out of sync.

### Deploy to Payload Cloud

#### Migrations

1. Connect your GitHub repository at [Payload Cloud](https://payloadcms.com)

2. Configure environment variables[Migrations](https://payloadcms.com/docs/database/migrations) are essentially SQL code versions that keeps track of your schema. When deploy with Postgres you will need to make sure you create and then run your migrations.

3. Deploy

Locally create a migration

### Self-Hosting

```bash

1. Build the application:pnpm payload migrate:create

   ```bash```

   pnpm build

   ```This creates the migration files you will need to push alongside with your new configuration.



2. Start the production server:On the server after building and before running `pnpm start` you will want to run your migrations

   ```bash

   pnpm start```bash

   ```pnpm payload migrate

```

3. Use a process manager like PM2:

   ```bashThis command will check for any migrations that have not yet been run and try to run them and it will keep a record of migrations that have been run in the database.

   pm2 start pnpm --name "digital-twin" -- start

   ```### Docker



## 🔐 Security ConsiderationsAlternatively, you can use [Docker](https://www.docker.com) to spin up this template locally. To do so, follow these steps:



✅ **Before Making Repository Public:**1. Follow [steps 1 and 2 from above](#development), the docker-compose file will automatically use the `.env` file in your project root

- ✅ All `.env` files removed from tracking1. Next run `docker-compose up`

- ✅ Comprehensive `.gitignore` configured1. Follow [steps 4 and 5 from above](#development) to login and create your first admin user

- ✅ `.env.example` with placeholder values only

- ✅ No hardcoded secrets in source codeThat's it! The Docker instance will help you get up and running quickly while also standardizing the development environment across your teams.

- ✅ Sensitive files excluded from git

### Seed

**Important**: Always use environment variables for:

- API keys and tokensTo seed the database with a few pages, posts, and projects you can click the 'seed database' link from the admin panel.

- Database credentials

- OAuth secretsThe seed script will also create a demo user for demonstration purposes only:

- Encryption keys

- Demo Author

## 🤝 Contributing  - Email: `demo-author@payloadcms.com`

  - Password: `password`

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:

> NOTICE: seeding the database is destructive because it drops your current database to populate a fresh one from the seed template. Only run this command if you are starting a new project or can afford to lose your current data.

1. Fork the repository

2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)## Production

3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)

4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)To run Payload in production, you need to build and start the Admin panel. To do so, follow these steps:

5. Open a Pull Request

1. Invoke the `next build` script by running `pnpm build` or `npm run build` in your project root. This creates a `.next` directory with a production-ready admin bundle.

## 📝 License1. Finally run `pnpm start` or `npm run start` to run Node in production and serve Payload from the `.build` directory.

1. When you're ready to go live, see Deployment below for more details.

There is also a simplified [one click deploy](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/templates/with-vercel-postgres) to Vercel should you need it.

### Self-hosting

Before deploying your app, you need to:

1. Ensure your app builds and serves in production. See [Production](#production) for more details.
2. You can then deploy Payload as you would any other Node.js or Next.js application either directly on a VPS, DigitalOcean's Apps Platform, via Coolify or more. More guides coming soon.

You can also deploy your app manually, check out the [deployment documentation](https://payloadcms.com/docs/production/deployment) for full details.
