## üåü NEXT STEPS FOR WEB APPLICATION INTEGRATION

### 1. Environment Variables Required
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://[connection_string]
UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL=https://[vector_endpoint]
UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN=[token]
```

### 2. RAG Integration Example
```python
from upstash_vector import Index

# Connect to vector database
vector_index = Index(url=UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL, token=UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN)

# Query for relevant content
results = vector_index.query_data(
    data="Tell me about your AI experience",
    top_k=5,
    include_metadata=True
)

# Results ready for LLM context
```

### 3. PostgreSQL Queries
```sql
-- Get professional profile
SELECT * FROM professionals WHERE id = '[professional_id]';

-- Get skills by category  
SELECT name, proficiency_level FROM skills WHERE category = 'technical';

-- Get recent projects
SELECT name, description, technologies FROM projects ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```
