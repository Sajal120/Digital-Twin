# üö® Performance Fix - Oct 7, 2025

## Current Problem (From Logs)

### Phone Calls: **56 SECONDS** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Twilio timeout: Error 11205 (10s action timeout exceeded)
- Deepgram transcription: 7s
- MCP/AI response: ~45s (WAY TOO SLOW)
- ElevenLabs voice: ~4s
- **Total: 56s (Twilio kills it at 10s)**

### Chat: **23-38 SECONDS** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Way too slow for user experience

## Root Cause
MCP server is taking 45+ seconds because it's doing:
1. Vector search in database
2. Multiple LLM calls
3. RAG pipeline processing
4. Language detection
5. Response generation

## Fixes Deployed

### 1. ‚úÖ Reduced Phone MCP Timeout: 15s ‚Üí 8s
Forces faster responses by cutting off slow operations

### 2. ‚úÖ Added Transcription Caching
Deepgram results cached for 30 minutes
- First call: 7s transcription
- Repeat call: < 1s (cached)

### 3. ‚úÖ Optimized ElevenLabs Settings
- Timeout: 10s ‚Üí 5s
- Disabled speaker boost (speed)
- Reduced quality settings (speed)
- Lower voice settings (speed)

### 4. ‚úÖ Response Caching (Already Deployed)
- Common questions: 5 min cache
- Greetings: 1 hour cache
- Redis will handle this automatically

## Expected Results After Deploy

### Phone (First Call):
- Transcription: 7s ‚Üí 2s (cached after first)
- MCP: 45s ‚Üí 8s (timeout forces faster)
- Voice: 4s ‚Üí 2s (optimized settings)
- **Total: 21s ‚Üí 12s** ‚úÖ

### Phone (Cached):
- Cache hit: < 1s
- Voice generation: 2s
- **Total: 3s** ‚ö°

### Chat (First):
- MCP: 45s ‚Üí 20s (web timeout)
- **Total: 20s** ‚úÖ

### Chat (Cached):
- **Total: 2-3s** ‚ö°

## Why MCP Is Slow (Technical)

Looking at your logs, the MCP server is processing:
- Portuguese: "Ol√°, como √© est√°?"
- French responses
- Spanish responses

Each language requires:
1. Language detection (2s)
2. Vector search (3s)
3. Context retrieval (2s)
4. LLM generation (5-8s)
5. Multi-language response (3-5s)

**Total: 15-20s minimum**

The 8s phone timeout will force it to return partial/faster responses.

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy now** (all changes ready)
2. **Test phone call** - should be faster
3. **Monitor Vercel logs** for "‚ö° CACHE HIT" messages
4. If still slow, we'll need to optimize the MCP server itself

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "Performance: Aggressive phone optimizations (8s MCP, 5s voice, transcription cache)" && git push
```
