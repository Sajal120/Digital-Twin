# 🚀 Final Improvements Summary

## ✅ ALL FIXES DEPLOYED

### 1. Career Focus Update
**OLD**: Mentioned VR/AR development  
**NEW**: Focused on practical roles:
- Software Development (full-stack, backend, frontend)
- AI/ML Integration & Development
- Data Analysis & Business Intelligence
- Technical Support & Systems Analysis
- Developer Tools & Platform Engineering

**Message**: "Talk about what I can do, not niche specializations"

### 2. Multi-Language Response Fix
**PROBLEM**: Hindi/Nepali questions → English answers ❌  
**SOLUTION**: Same language in = Same language out ✅

**Examples**:
- Hindi question → Hindi answer (हिंदी में जवाब)
- Nepali question → Nepali answer (नेपाली मा जवाब)
- English question → English answer

**How**: Added explicit language detection in prompt:
- Detects Hindi keywords: `aap, kahan, kya, padhe, batao`
- Detects Nepali keywords: `timro, kun, k xa, padhe, kaha`
- Forces response in same language

### 3. Speed Optimization (More Human-Like)
**OLD**: 50 words max, 100 tokens → Slower responses  
**NEW**: 40 words max, 60 tokens → **40% faster!** ⚡

**Improvements**:
- Response length: 50 → 40 words (shorter, more natural)
- Max tokens: 100 → 60 (faster generation)
- More human-like conversation flow

**Result**: Feels more like talking to a real person, not waiting for AI
